# Welcome! 
My name is Samantha Sunnarborg. I am a Physics PhD student at Brown University in Providence, RI. I work at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) which is a general purpose particle detector on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. I am a Trigger Contact for the CMS Exotica Analysis Group and I contribute to the operation and upgrade of the Silicon Tracker at CMS. My analysis is a search for Long-Lived Particles using Displaced Jets, specifically looking for a dark matter candidate that may manifest in Emerging Jets in CMS. I am a part of a multi-collaboration project working to build AI tools for High Energy and Astrophysics experiments across the globe. I also conduct research on future detectors where I focus on utilizing Neural Networks to improve the performance of AC-LGADs, a new silicon technology that is the future of particle detectors.
Take some time to peruse my site! Thanks for stopping by, and please feel free to contact me with any questions or interests :)
